## Data structure ##

Test includes a list of Plates that are available to download from URL indocated by resources attribute. Each type of test is need both Plate and Result classes(interfaces) extended(implemented) in order to properly interpret values marked as awaited and given by a test subject; in Ishihara test example on a picture they are numbers that represents normal sight, and deficiencies (red-green deficincies with care for protan/deutan results and total colour-blindness). To ensure that all (also future types of tests) will be shown on the mobile screen properly, we need to extend base class TestActivity to match test type. If an extra answer is needed for a specific plate like eg plate 16 in Ishihara test it is placed in Result class extention (IshiharaResult); this will also allow to create a test type where answers could be more complex (more steps) or of different type (String, Array etc). ResultSet in addition to a set of Results contains metadata (not defined yet) that could be eg. local time, light intensity while test taken or general personal data (gender, age etc) if accepted by user and needed for research. If publish the ResultSet will be send to defined in Test server (this need to be implemented separately if results are to be gathered).
