## Colour vision deficiency application ##
An application that can help to detect colour vision deficiency. The main goal is that it can run standard tests, like basic Ishihara test, with some variance in plates, like e.g. randomized sequence of plates. Those test are usually done using printed plates in a controlled test environment. The basic variant of the Ishihara test we are implementing consists of the plates with numbers only; we treat an input from user as a free numerical text not buttons that could suggest an answer (or make guessing easier).
