# External services needed for application (run remotely prepared tests mode): #
## Plates resources ##
Expecting test to be uploaded by researcher to resource server packed in a <TestID>.zip file.
The zip file consists of a set of plate pictures; they should use integers as file names (filename coresponds with Plate.id in data structure) additional JSON file with Test metadata (named <TestID>.json) this metadata will be stored on local storage (database) when test will be downloaded. Test ID could be generated by the same server that is used to upload set of pictures; so all pictures are packed together with metadata. (json could be skipped in a zip file and saved to local storage in <TestID> folder together with unpacked pictures)

* Test metadata structure in JSON
```
#!json
{
  "id":           String,   // uuid()
  "name":         String,   //
  "description":  String,   //
  "url":          String,   // 
  "type":         String,   // enum? test type
  "version":      int,      // 
  "created":      int,      // timestamp
}

```
## Available tests database ##
API that responses with an array of JSON objects (available test as shown above). Those objects will be used to populate
