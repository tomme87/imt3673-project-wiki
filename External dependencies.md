# External services needed for application (run remotely prepared tests mode): #
## Plates resources ##
Expecting test to be uploaded by researcher to resource server packed in a <TestID>.zip file.
The zip file consists of a set of plate pictures; they should use integers as file names (filename coresponds with Plate.id in data structure) additional JSON file with an array of Plate objects eg plates.json
Test ID could be generated by the same server that is used to upload set of pictures; so all pictures are packed together with metadata. (json could be skipped in a zip file and saved to local storage in <TestID> folder together with unpacked pictures or in local database).
As in IshiharaPlate example below, for basic red-green deficiency attributes "protanStrong" and "deutanStrong" should be the same. If "extra' attribute is set to "true" it means that plate is an additional one to differentiate between Protan and Deutan. Do not count it towards result check.

* IshiharaPlate example
```
#!json
IshiharaPlate
{
  "id":           int,    //  plate id 
  "filename"      String  //  file path <TestID>/"filename"
  "normal":       int,    //  expected input value for normal vision
  "protanStrong": int,    //  expected input value for vision deficiency
  "deutanStrong": int,    //  expected input value for vision deficiency
  "total":        int,    //  expected input value for total color blindness
  "extra":        bool    //  if true this plate is not to be in calculation of primary results  
}
```

## Available tests database ##
API that responses with an array of JSON objects (available test as shown above). Those objects will be used to populate the list of test available for downloding. Test metadata will be stored on local storage (database) when test is downloaded. Optional is to request array of Plates that represents test elements, store it in local database (NoSQL?) or filesystem in the folder <TestID> with pictures.

* Test metadata structure in JSON
```
#!json
TestInfo
{
  "id":           String,   // uuid()
  "name":         String,   // test name
  "description":  String,   // test description
  "resourceUrl":  String,   // URL to <TestID>.zip file
  "resultsUrl":   String,   // URL to POST results to
  "type":         String,   // test type eg "Ishihara"
  "version":      int,      // if used
  "created":      int,      // timestamp
  "firstPlate"    int       // null if not relevant  
}

```
