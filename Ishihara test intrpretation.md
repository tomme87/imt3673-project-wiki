First picture shows how to interpret results from a plate that doesn't distinguish between protan/deutan deficiency. It is expected that in this case values of attributes IshiharaPlate.protanStrong and IshiharaPlate.deutanStrong are the same and that indicate general red-green deficiency.

When attributes IshiharaPlate.protanStrong and IshiharaPlate.deutanStrong are NOT the same and the IshiharaPlate.extra has value 'true' giving edge answers indicates strong deficiency (DS, PS) while a 'normal' answer means one of three possibilities:

* Mild Protan (MP)
* Normal (N)
* Mild Deutan (MD)

Alternative could be an extra question will be asked about which of the numbers is more clear for a test subject. Example of plate number 16 is presented on a picture below.

After discussion we decided to use standard Ishihara test interpretation. Plates 1-15 indicates deficiency, plates 16 and 17 could indicate additional Protan/Deutan but only strong version. The application will not ask additional question.
